# Simple React.js "Hello world" Application

Minimum requirement to use React.js + Node.js + Express.js

# Installation

Use Git to clone this app, then:

```
npm install
```

# Commands

Start the server with all the code transpiled and bundled in a single command:

```
npm run start
```

Transpile all the ES6/ES2015 JavaScript to ES5 for Node and browsers

```
npm run build
```

Bundle all the client-side JavaScript into a single file (`public/js/bundle.js`)

```
npm run bundle
```

# Why?

When I want to refresh my react knowledge, I found it's hard to find project that only use minimum amount
external dependencies, which made me spend more time to learn those dependencies than react self.

This project:

I borrowed code base from vlucas[https://github.com/vlucas/universal-react-helloworld], and stripped down the servers side code for isomorphic
